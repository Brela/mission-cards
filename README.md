## Live Site
https://missionchatgpt.com/

## Start it Up
* add *.env* file to client/ and server/ folders. Ask me for the contents
* cd client -> npm install -> npm run dev
* cd server -> npm install -> npm run dev
* go to http://localhost:4000/ in browser

### Notes
* The front-end (client folder) uses typeScript because I wanted to learn TypeScript
* The back-end (server folder) uses plain JS because it helped simplify the build
