- Frontend: Load the Google API library and initialize the Google Sign-In button in your React component.

- Frontend: When a user clicks the Sign-In or Sign-Up button, the Google API library will open a popup for the user to choose their Google account and grant the necessary permissions.

- Frontend: After successful authentication, Google will return an object that includes the user's ID token.

- Frontend: Your app should send this ID token to your backend server.

- Backend: Your server should verify the ID token using Google's API or an appropriate library.

- Backend: If the ID token is valid, your server should create or update the user's account in your app's database and establish a session for the user.

- Backend: Return an appropriate response to the frontend, such as a success message and user data.
